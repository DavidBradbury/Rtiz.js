		<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.</p>
		
		<p>He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>
		
		<p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>
		
		<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</p>
		
		<p>"What's happened to me? " he thought.</p>
		
		<p>It wasn't a dream.</p>
		
		<p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
		
		<p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>
		
		<p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
		
		<p>Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
